Lab #2 Instructions
======================================================
Design a portable file access system that can work
with any project that needs file access. Try not to make
any of your file access code dependent on other classes
in a project (e.g., your Garage project).

A well-designed file access system will have a high-level service class
that delegates to reader and/or writer objects based on abstraction (the
Strategy Pattern).

Test your code by adding a main method to the service class.
