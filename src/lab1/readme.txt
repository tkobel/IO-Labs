Lab #1 Instructions
======================================================
Create a simple contact list (at least three entries, 
each containing first name, last name, street addres, 
city, state, zip, email, phone fields) in Notepad. 
Use any format you choose as long as it is your own 
custom format (e.g., one field per line, or multi-fields 
per line using a custom delimiter). Store this file anywhere 
outside of your project folder. Now perform these tasks:

   1. Read all records and output all to console
   2. Read just the second record and output it to the console
   3. Add a new record by appending the file. Then read all 
      records back in and output to console to confirm that the 
      new record can be read.
